## Comments

Few tasks are not implement becuase the are not in the requirments.

1. Filter is not described in the task so I left a placeholder for it.
2. The look of the wishlist is different from the requirments becuase a lack of time but if it is mandatiry I can easly do it. I just ReUse the book list component.
3. Forgot password is not implemented.
4. The actions in the top bar are not implemented.
5. I used primeng as my third party.
6. Also I didn't use any mock server like json-server to keep the wishlist so it will reset on refresh or re-enter the application. It was not clear on the task definitions but if it is neccessery I can easly do it.
7. If the title is to long i show one line with elipsis. same to authors. I take only the first author in case there is more than one.
